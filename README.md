# Alex Eastabrook

## About Me
I like to solve problems, understand the way things work, and create interesting or novel things.
>With this being said : *I feel like I found a good fit with a career in Engineering.* 

## Hobbies
#### Running 🏃 
Although 2020 has been an '''Off Year''' for me. In 2019 I traveled the country doing multiple ultra-marathons. 

I keep a list of the major events that I have done here : https://github.com/eastabrooka/BestOfRunning

#### Reading 📚📙 
Big fan of Audiobooks. Goes hand-in-hand with running, walking, hiking. 

I keep a list of most of the books that I read here : https://github.com/eastabrooka/Books 

#### Making 📐🔩🔨
I enjoy DIY, Woodworking, Electronic tinkering, and generally 'Making Stuff'. 

I want to add some completed DIY Projects soon.
